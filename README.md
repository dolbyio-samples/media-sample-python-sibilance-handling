# Improve Speech by Controlling Sibilance with Python

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that was
shared as part of the Dolby.io blog post titled
[Improve Speech by Controlling Sibilance with Python](https://dolby.io/blog/improve-speech-by-controlling-sibilance) by Rudy Trubitt.

# Overview
Given the overview of sibilance in speech and how it can negatively impact the quality of audio recordings, the Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the Dolby.io Media API to detect and remove sibilance from audio files. 

# Requirements 
Some knowledge of audio processing and Python may be helpful in understanding the concepts and code presented in the blog. To follow along with the tutorial you would need to have Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy and librosa libraries installed. The instructions on how to install these dependencies are explicit in the code. 

# Getting Started 
As part of performing the detection and removal of sibilance, you would need to sign up for a <a href="https://dashboard.dolby.io/signup/"> Dolby.io account.</a> You receive 50GBs to start out for free, which should help you get started with this project. 

Make sure you have your <a href="https://dolby.io/developers/media-processing/quick-start/analyzing-media#1-get-your-api-key"> API key ready </a> and a pre-signed URL before uploading your audio file for enhancing. 

# Troubleshooting 
In the case any bugs occur, report it using Github issues and we will see to it.
